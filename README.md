# Rails 5 Devise Omniauth Omniauth-Facebook Bootstrap

This base project aims to make using `devise`, `omniauth`, `omniauth-facebook`, and `bootstrap` as simple as possible. All that is required is creating a Facebook app, adding your app_id and app_secret to the .env file, editing the .gitignore file to include .env so you don't share your app credentials with the world if pushing to a public repository, and voila.

More instructions to come once I get a chance to breath. Thanks for our support!

You'll probably want to update the naming in this file https://github.com/joshuaneedham/rails-5-devise-omniauth-facebook-bootstrap/blob/master/config/application.rb
